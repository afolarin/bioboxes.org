# The bioboxes manifesto

Software has proliferated in bioinformatics and so have the problems associated
with it: missing or unobtainable code, difficult to install dependencies,
unreproducible workflows, all with terrible user experiences. We believe a
community standard, using software containers, has the opportunity to solve
these problems and increase the standard of scientific software as a whole.

In this manifesto, we ask everyone to help create a community standard through
bioboxes. We want to fix these problems and make bioinformatics software usable
for as many people as possible. A standard for bioinformatics containers will
move us towards a more open environment for anyone to innovate, collaborate and
share their scientific software. Working in a truly standardized and
interoperable ecosystem, will allow bioinformatics algorithmic developments to
become useful to everyone.

Bioboxes's target audience is users. A biobox should be as simple to use as
possible for both a biologist or a bioinformatician. This project will help
software developers create bioboxes by providing documentation and tooling but
the ultimate goal is making software usable for end users. Any decision made
about the bioboxes standard should be made with the question:

*Does this make bioinformatics software simpler and more usable?*
